# Project Title: Bank Management System

## Description:
This C program implements a basic Bank Management System that allows users to perform common banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, checking balances, and viewing transaction history.

## Features:
Account Creation: Users can create different types of accounts (e.g., savings, current) with unique account numbers.
Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their existing accounts.
Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts, subject to balance limits and transaction fees.
Balance Inquiry: Users can check their current account balance.
Transaction History: Users can view a list of their recent transactions.

## Usage:
Compile: Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to create an executable file.
Run: Execute the executable file to start the Bank Management System.
Follow Prompts: The program will display a menu of options. Select the desired operation and follow the on-screen instructions.
Data Structure:
The system likely uses a data structure (e.g., linked list, array) to store account information and transaction history.

## Additional Considerations:
Error Handling: Implement error handling to prevent invalid inputs and potential system crashes.
Security: Consider security measures to protect sensitive customer data, such as encryption and password hashing.
Scalability: If the system is expected to handle a large number of users and transactions, consider scalability factors like database integration and performance optimization.
User Interface: Enhance the user experience with a clear and intuitive interface, including error messages and informative prompts.
